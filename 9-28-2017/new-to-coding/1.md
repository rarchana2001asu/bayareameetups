## 1. What is a program

Start at play.golang.org

Run the "Hello World" program and see the output below.

Briefly go over the Anatomy of a Go program. 

What is a package? 
What is main?
What is an import?
What is a func?
What does running a program mean? 

```
// source files are organized into system directories called packages to enable code reusability.
// package main for making the package as an executable program.
package main

// The keyword “import” is used for importing a package into other packages.
// fmt comes from GO standard library
import "fmt"

// They have inputs, outputs and a series of steps called statements which are executed in order.
// func main is the entry point of execution.
func main() {
	//Println formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to standard output
	fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
